## SCENARIO

> AtliQ Hardware, with multiple branches across India, provides computer hardware and peripheral manufacturers to its clients. HR department want to know working preference of people, between work from home and work from office. They need to have a comprehensive view of the attendance records of all employees, including the number of leaves taken and reasons for absence.

#### Problem:

> HR department want to know working preference of people, between work from home and work from office. so if they are taking frequent work from home either on monday or friday so what could be the reason behind that.

#### Stakeholders:

## PREPARE

> In this phase, I will collect the Attendance data from the below link:</br>
We will be using Attendance historical data [here](https://codebasics.io/resources?utm_source=description&utm_medium=yt&utm_campaign=description&utm_id=description) for 3 months between April 2022-June 2022.


## PROCESS

>In this phase, I cleand the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values and make the data accurate for analysis using Power BI query editor. The data file was consist of 3 sheets for each month, April to June. I combined all the sheets into one sheet to do better analysis.

## ANALYZE

>Now itâ€™s time to analyze the data and look for key information that we can perform analysis on. Here some questions we need to answer for acheving our solution. I solved all the questions by creating a complete Power BI dashboard

1. Find the Percentage for Attendance , Work from Home and Sick Leave using 3 months data.
2. Display Employee Attendance %, Work from Home % and Sick Leave % in a table.
3. Display Employee daily attendance in a table.
4. Show Attendance % over time using area chart.
5. Show Sick leave % over time using area chart.
6. Show Work from Home % over time using area chart.
7. Display Weekly Attendance % in a table.
8. Display Weekly Sick leave % in a table.
9. Display Weekly Work from Home % in a table.
10. Create a slicer for Months that we interact with each month.

>Let's go through the main finds and try to arrive at a conclusion.

1. Based on the given 3 months data, the percentages for Attendance, Work from Home (WFH), and Sick Leave (SL) are as follows:

- Attendance: 91.76%
- Work from Home (WFH): 10.00%
- Sick Leave (SL): 1.10%

> Observation:
The company shows high attendance, offers WFH flexibility, and has a low sick leave rate, indicating a positive work environment.

2. There is a slight decrease in employees attendance over time.

> Observation:
Attendance might have been affected by seasonal events or holidays that occurred in May, leading to reduced workdays or planned leaves.

3. There is an slight increase in the Sick leave trend over time in month of May.
> Observation:
This suggests a possible increase in health-related issues or other factors leading to more sick leaves compared to previous months.

4. There is an increase in the trend where people opted for Work from home.
> Observation:
This indicates a growing preference for remote work, possibly due to improved remote work facilities or changing work dynamics.

5. Most people attended office on Mondays.

6. Most people took sick leaves on Mondays.

7. Most people opted for Work from home on Fridays.
> Observation:
This pattern suggests that employees may choose remote work on Fridays to enjoy a more flexible schedule, avoid commuting, and potentially extend their weekend plans.


## ACT
>The act phase would be done by the HR department of the company.

>Based on the observations mentioned earlier, the HR department can infer the following about the working preference of people between Work from Home (WFH) and working from the office:

1. Increasing WFH Trend: There is a noticeable increase in the trend of employees opting for Work from Home over time. This indicates a growing preference for remote work.

2. Friday Preference for WFH: A significant number of employees tend to opt for WFH on Fridays, possibly due to the approaching weekend. This suggests a desire for a more flexible schedule and the opportunity to extend their weekend plans.
